### Schedule as a Gitlab CI task

1. Fork this repo.
1. [Schedule a pipeline](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/pipelines/schedules.html)
    to your desired signin/signout intervals. You can use the cron syntax to create a single schedule (`0 9,13,14,18 * * MON-FRI`) or create different schedules depending on the time of the year, like months of _full working days_ (`0 9,13,14,18 * 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,9,10,11,12 MON-FRI`) and months of _intensive working days_ (`0 8,15 * 8 MON-FRI`).
1. Add `WOFFU_COMPANY`, `WOFFU_USERNAME`, and `WOFFU_PASSWORD` as [CI variables](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/variables/).
1. Let Gitlab CI/CD work its magic ðŸ§™ (even receiving an email if in the process something went wrong).
